The DEBrowser docker image at this [location](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/nephantes/debrowser-docker) does not work and the dockerfile at this [location](https://github.com/nephantes/debrowser-docker) does not build, as it references a file that no longer exists in the github repo (shiny-server.R) and some packages listed could not be installed when I tried to build it (e.g., the unstable package).
